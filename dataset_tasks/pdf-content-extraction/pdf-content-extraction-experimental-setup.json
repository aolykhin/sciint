The low affinity glucose sensor Rgt2 is endocytosed and targeted to the vacuole for degradation in glucose-starved cells but is stable in cells grown in high glucose medium. Expression of the high affinity glucose sensor Snf3 is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels: Snf3 is internalized and degraded not only in high glucose-grown cells but also in glucose-depleted cells; its expression is repressed by high glucose concentrations but derepressed in the absence of glucose.

SA accumulates upon oviposition and the expression of SA- and NPR1-dependent genes (e.g. PR1) is activated (Little et al., 2007; Bruessow et al., 2010, Gouhier-Darimont et al., 2013). In addition, egg-induced SA accumulation is known to inhibit larvae-induced expression of JA-dependent genes (e.g. VSP2; Bruessow et al., 2010). Here, we show that this SA/JA antagonism is mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation of MYC3, MYC3, and MYC4 (MYCs) transcription factors, which regulate the expression of JA-responsive genes in response to herbivory. We identified another level of regulation by the transcription factor WRKY75, whose expression is induced by eggs. Overexpression of WRKY75 compensates for MYC degradation by inducing VSP2 expression. On the contrary, NPR1 and EIN2 collectively inhibit WRKY75 activity, leading to an attenuated VSP2 expression in response to herbivory. The balanced positive and negative effects of oviposition on WRKY75 may underlie an ongoing arms race between eggs that inhibit JA-dependent defenses for the benefit of larvae and the plant that tries to overcome this inhibition. Finally, we show that ET controls egg-induced PDF1.2 expression synergistically with JA-induced PDF1.2 expression and that the ERF branch of the JA pathway is not subjected to egg-induced SA/JA antagonism. This model postulates that insect eggs trigger ET accumulation, but this has to be experimentally validated.", "figure-url": "http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/170/4/2432/F6.large.jpg"}}, "pdf-url": "http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/170/4/2432.full.pdf"}, "PDF-00008": {"pdf-path": "scientific-integrity-dataset-v8/10.1182_blood.v97.1.147/article/paper.pdf", "pdf-figures": {"fig1": {"bbox-loc": {"p": 2, "y0": 297, "y1": 709, "x0": 62, "x1": 317}, "figure-path": "scientific-integrity-dataset-v8/10.1182_blood.v97.1.147/figures/fig1.jpg", "caption-path": "scientific-integrity-dataset-v8/10.1182_blood.v97.1.147/figures/fig1.txt", "caption-txt": "Specific time points of the neutropenia cycle at which bone marrow aspirations were obtained from CN patients.The aspirations were obtained prior to (A) and during (B) G-CSF treatment.

ARPP19 is phosphorylated by PKA at S109 in prophase-arrested oocytes. The molecular targets of the single S109-phosphorylated form of ARPP19 that are responsible for the prophase arrest are unknown. Our study shows that S109 phosphorylation does not prevent ARPP19 phosphorylation at S67 by Gwl. In response to progesterone, PKA activity drops down and consequently, ARPP19 is dephosphorylated at S109. This event unlocks a signaling pathway that generates a threshold activity of Cdk1. Once this starter amount of Cdk1 is formed, it induces Gwl activation that in turn phosphorylates ARPP19 at S67. As a consequence, PP2A-B55\u03b4 is inhibited and the MPF auto-amplification loop is launched. Moreover, ARPP19 is also re-phosphorylated at S109 by an unknown kinase distinct of PKA. This phosphorylation contributes to M-phase entry. Hence, the active form of ARPP19 that sustains Cdk1 activation does not only rely on phosphorylation at S67 as previously thought, but also on its concomitant phosphorylation at S109.", "figure-url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553396/bin/kccy-16-15-1338985-g007.jpg"}}, "pdf-url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15384101.2017.1338985?needAccess=true"}, "PDF-00048": {"pdf-path": "scientific-integrity-dataset-v8/10.1074_jbc.M610949200/article/paper.pdf", "pdf-figures": {"fig1": {"bbox-loc": {"p": 3, "y0": 58, "y1": 261, "x0": 315, "x1": 544}, "figure-path": "scientific-integrity-dataset-v8/10.1074_jbc.M610949200/figures/fig1.jpg", "caption-path": "scientific-integrity-dataset-v8/10.1074_jbc.M610949200/figures/fig1.txt", "caption-txt": "FIGURE 1.

Proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and TNF-\u03b2) reach the synovial fluid through the bloodstream and can directly induce inflammation in chondrocytes, which leads to expression and production of cytokine receptors such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b2 receptors in the chondrocytes. TNF-\u03b2-induced inflammatory signaling in chondrocytes is further enhanced by upregulation of TNF-\u03b2 production in T and B cells, by direct interaction of T and B cells with the chondrocytes and by autostimulation of the chondrocytes themselves. Downstream inflammation signaling of TNF-\u03b2 in chondrocytes involves nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), leading to the production of proinflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2 and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2)), cartilage matrix degradation (matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP-13) and apoptotic cascades (cleavage of caspase 3 and p53).

In the absence of pheromone the GEF, Efc25 promotes GDP for GTP exchange on Ras1. Through a complex with a Rho-GEF, Scd1, Ras1-GTP activates the essential G protein, Cdc42 so allowing polarized cell growth, faithful chromosome segregation and cell division. A second GEF for Cdc42, Gef1, is required to initiate bipolar growth but is not activated by Ras1. Upon pheromone stimulation, Ras1 activation is increased through interaction with another Ras1-GEF, Ste6. This pool of Ras1-GTP propagates the transcriptional response (acting via a second effector, Byr2 and a MAPK cascade). Pheromone-activated Ras1 also induces further GTP exchange on Cdc42 through activation of Scd1 promoting unidirectional cell growth towards a mating partner.

Integrated DNA, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) messenger RNA, PAH enzyme activity, and BH4 content in liver extracts of gene-treated phenylketonuria (PKU) mice. Partial hepatectomy was performed at weeks 10 and 24 on PAH gene\u2013treated PKU mice, and at week 36, the mice were killed. The liver extracts were prepared for the measurement of integrated DNA, PAH activity, and BH4 concentrations. (a) Genome copy number of integrated plasmid DNA (pDNA). The extracted genomic DNAs were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the copy number of the pDNA integrated in mpsP3. After cessation of BH4 administration at week 10, the integrated pDNA content was approximately 3.2% per haploid genome in both gene-treated male (light gray column, n= 12) and female PKU mice with (gray column, n = 7) or without (bias filled column, n = 7) BH4 administration. This number remained unchanged at week 24, which was 7 weeks after gonadectomy, and at week 36, which was 8 weeks after cessation of sex hormone treatments. No significant difference was observed in samples from treated male and female PKU mice during the experiment (P > 0.05). No detectable signal was observed from the liver samples of untreated PKU mice (filled column, n = 12). (b) PAH enzyme activity. In the liver extracts of treated PKU mice, PAH activity per mg protein was determined. Compared with normal mouse liver extracts, there was 50% activity in the heterozygotes (open column, n = 6) as expected. PAH activity in the liver extracts of gene-treated PKU mice was approximately 17%, and there was no significant difference between the males (light gray column, n= 7) and females (with BH4 treatment, gray column, n = 7; without BH4 treatment, bias filled column, n = 7) at weeks 10, 24, and 36 (P > 0.5). In untreated PKU mice (filled column, n = 6), the level was less than 1% of normal. Neither BH4 administration nor gonadectomy and sex hormone treatments led to any change of PAH enzyme activity in the livers of PAH gene\u2013treated PKU mice (P > 0.1). (c) BH4 levels in liver extracts. The liver extracts were also used to determine the BH4 concentrations, expressed as pmol/mg protein. The results were analyzed with Student's t-test. The untreated heterozygous mice were used to measure the background BH4 concentration in the liver extracts, which was 50% lower in female samples (filled column, n = 6) than in male samples (open column, n = 6). The BH4 concentrations in PAH gene\u2013treated homozygous male liver extracts (light gray columns, n = 12) remained stable after PAH gene treatment (P > 0.1) and castration (P > 0.1), but decreased significantly after estrogen treatment (P < 0.05). In the PAH gene\u2013treated female homozygous mice, things were more complex. After daily BH4 supply, their liver BH4 content (gray column, n = 7) increased to the male range (P > 0.05), whereas in those without BH4 supply (bias filled column, n = 7) the BH4 concentration was similar to that in the untreated heterozygous females (P > 0.05). After gonadectomy surgery, the BH4 concentration significantly increased when compared with the untreated female samples (P < 0.05) and then remained stable after androgen treatment (P > 0.05).
