# SILA: A System for Scientific Image Analysis
**Under Construction.**
Source codes to reproduce experimental results of a paper currently under review.
More information about this paper will soon be added here.

## Scientific Papers Dataset
To support assessing the efficacy of the system proposed in the paper, we collected a dataset of scientific manuscripts containing annotated image manipulations and inadvertent figure reuse.
This dataset is available in the following project branch:  
* [SILA Dataset](https://git.io/JcZsX)

## System Modules
The implementation and test scripts of the modules composing the proposed system are individually made available in the following project branches:  
* [PDF Content Extraction](https://git.io/JcZGM)
* [Image Ranking](https://git.io/JcZGo)
* [Panel Segmentation](https://git.io/JcZG2)
* [Copy-Move Detection](https://git.io/JcZGR)
* [Provenance Analysis](https://git.io/JcZGl)

*More content and details soon.*
