# PDF Content Extraction 
A  PDF Figure extraction tool for scientific documents.

The *PDF content extraction tool* extracts all figures along with their captions embedded in scientific PDF documents. The solution finds all figures embedded in the PDF document (source code) that were inserted during the document preparation.

As a special feature, the tool can extract figures from PDFs that suffered a certain level of corruption.

For instance, a figure that was cropped into several pieces due to an PDF error would be fixed:

## Figure Extraction

### Instruction

A Dockerfile wrapping the solution and all needed environment is set in the `/docker`. 

To build the docker use:

​	`$ cd docker && ./build`

After this, use the script `run_image_extraction.sh` file to communicate with the docker and perform PDF figure extraction with the following command:

` $ run_image_extraction.sh <input_pdf_path> <output_directory> ` 



All extracted figures are saved in PNG and named as its position on the document followed by a figure ID. Example:

```
p-4-x0-40.000-y0-59.280-x1-553.600-y1-492.000-1.png
page = 4
x0   = 40.000
y0   = 59.280
x1   = 553.600
y1   = 492.000
ID   = 1
```



**Caption-only Extraction**

If you want to extract only the figures caption, follow the instructions located at [caption_extraction](https://github.com/danielmoreira/sciint/tree/pdf-content-extraction/caption_extraction).



# Evaluation

To evaluate the *PDF figure extraction*, we annotated the figures and caption of 297 PDFs scientific papers and downloaded the original figures and caption from its publishers' official website.

The file [pdf-content-extraction-experimental-setup.json](dataset_tasks/pdf-content-extraction/pdf-content-extraction-experimental-setup.json) contains all annotation that we used to evaluate the tool (i.e., Figures URLs, PDF URLs, Figure positions, Caption texts).



### Figure Extraction Evaluation

To evaluate the figure extraction, we compared the extracted figures with the figures downloaded from the paper's website.

**Metric**

[Structural similarity index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) (SSIM).
We use the implementation of the scikit image library [4] during this evaluation.

**Score**

Average SSIM  = 76 (30)



You can reproduce our results by running the [PDF Image Extraction](PDF%20Image%20Extraction.ipynb) Notebook.



### Text Evaluation 

To evaluate text extraction, we compared the extracted caption with the caption presented in the paper's website.

**Metrics**

1. [BERT-SCORE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675) F1-measure [2]

   This metric compares the semantic contextual of two sentences.

   We use the implementation of [2] with the sci-bert-en model ( BERT trained on  Scientific English documents) during the evaluation. 

2. [Levenshtein Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)

   This metric calculates the similarity of two strings based on the Levenshtein Distances, which consider each insertion, deletion, substitution alongside two strings.

   For this metric, we use the implementation of [3] during the evaluation.

**Score**

1. Average Bert-Score = 0.86 (0.27)
2. Average Levenshtein Similarity = 0.82  (0.33)

You can reproduce our results by running the [PDF Caption Extraction](PDF%20Caption%20Extraction.ipynb) Notebook.
