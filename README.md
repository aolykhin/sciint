## Scientific Papers Dataset
To support assessing the efficacy of the system proposed in the paper, we collected a dataset of scientific manuscripts containing annotated image manipulations and inadvertent figure reuse.
This dataset is available in the following project branch:  
* [SILA Dataset](https://git.io/JcZsX)

*Disclaimer.*
Each paper in the dataset is referred to by its public Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
Inclusion in the dataset does not necessarily signify that an article is the subject of any research misconduct practice, allegation, or proceeding.

## System Modules
The implementation and test scripts of the modules composing the proposed system are individually made available in the following project branches:  
* [PDF Content Extraction](https://git.io/JcZGM)
* [Image Ranking](https://git.io/JcZGo)
* [Panel Segmentation](https://git.io/JcZG2)
* [Copy-Move Detection](https://git.io/JcZGR)
* [Provenance Analysis](https://git.io/JcZGl)
