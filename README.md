# Content Segmentation 

This module segments  compound figure into panels (region of interest). For this task, we used the implementation of Satoshi Tsutsui, and David Crandall [1]. Their code, model and weights can be found in this [link](https://github.com/apple2373/figure-separator). 

# Evaluation

### Ground-Truth

To evaluate the method [1] on our data, first, two experts annotated the coordinates of each region of interest from a subset of figures from our dataset. Then, to generate the final ground-truth we selected the regions where the specialist agreed - AND Map. Thus, for each figure from the subset, we generate a binary map that indicates where the regions of interest are.

- We are making available our ground-truth data here and a adapted version of FigureSeparete[1] - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PSrtJ5RK9Xy3mX0EBwR9ICz_ot8ytaSD/view?usp=sharing) 
- There you find the annotation of each expert (xp1,xp2); the AND map (xp1_and_xp2); a CSV file with infos related to the selected figure subset; an a adapted version of FigureSeparte for our data.

### Metric

We use the **Jaccard** metric to evaluate the regions generated by [1] on our ground-truth.

All the evaluation process can be found in the `Content Segmentation` notebook.
